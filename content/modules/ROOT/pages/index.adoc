== Introduction

Lab Overview
In this lab, we will demonstrate how OpenShift Platform Plus helps manage and secure multi-cluster deployments. OpenShift Platform Plus includes the core features of OpenShift Container Platform and adds four key components for better management and security:

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)
* Red Hat Quay (Quay)
* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (RHODF)

Participants will learn how to:

* *Developers:* Build, deploy and scan applications with Quay
* *Operations:* Deploy Clusters, Virtual Machines, and applications with RHACM
* *Security:* Secure applications with RHACS

== OpenShift Platform Plus Applications

=== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM)

RHACM helps manage Kubernetes clusters across hybrid and multicloud environments. It provides a unified console for policy-based governance, observability, and automation.

In this workshop, we’ll show how to:

* Deploy clusters in the cloud
* Manage Virtual Machines
* Set governance policies for cluster security
* Apply application deployment policies across clusters*

=== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS)
RHACS enhances security for Kubernetes workloads in any cloud, including OpenShift, AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and Google GKE.

In this workshop, we’ll cover:

* Exploring the RHACS console to identify vulnerable workloads
* Viewing network graphs and metrics
* Applying deployment and runtime security policies

=== Red Hat Quay
Red Hat Quay is a private, secure, and scalable container image registry. It stores containerized software across distributed datacenters and cloud environments.

In this workshop, we’ll demonstrate:

* Download, build and store a Python application in Quay
* Uploading and exploring container images in the registry

=== Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (RHODF)
RHODF provides software-defined storage for containers. It supports rapid application development and deployment across cloud environments.

NOTE: While we won’t use RHODF directly in this workshop, it will be used as the primary storage for our Quay registry and other applications needing persistent storage.

== Environment architecture and useful information
The OpenShift 4 cluster for this lab is hosted on AWS and will be your central hub for tasks. The cluster setup includes:

1. One OpenShift cluster (Named: "local-cluster") containing:
* Three control-plane nodes
* Three worker nodes

2. The secondary cluster in AWS (Named: "development"), using Hosted Control Planes (HCP)

3. You will "provision" a new cluster in the ACM module that will fail during deployment.

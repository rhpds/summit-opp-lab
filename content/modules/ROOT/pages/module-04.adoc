= Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes

[[outline]]

== Module outline

This lab's goal is to showcase the features of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) while observing the Java application that you deployed earlier in the Quay module. 

We will start with the basics of navigation and progress into vulnerability management, policy management and enforcement and finish with CI/CD integration. 

=== RHACS basics

RHACS provides the tools and capabilities to address the security needs of a cloud-native development approach on Kubernetes. These security features represent any developer or administrator’s primary work across various environments, including multiple datacenters, private clouds, or public clouds that run Kubernetes clusters.

=== RHACS features

Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, you can gain comprehensive Kubernetes security that includes the following use cases:

- *Visibility:* See your entire landscape of images, registries, containers, deployments, and runtime behavior.
- *Vulnerability* Management: Identify and remediate vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes across the entire software development life cycle.
- *Compliance:* Audit your systems against CIS Benchmarks, NIST, PCI, and HIPAA, with interactive dashboards and one-click audit reports.
- *Network Segmentation:* Visualize existing connections and enforce tighter segmentation using Kubernetes-native controls to reduce your blast radius.
- *Risk Profiling:* See all your deployments ranked by risk level, using context from Kubernetes' declarative data, to prioritize remediation.
- *Configuration Management:* Apply best practices for Docker and Kubernetes to harden your environment for a more secure and stable application.
- *Threat Detection:* Use rules, automated allow lists, and baselining to accurately identify suspicious activity in your running applications.
- *Incident Response:* Take action, from failing builds and blocking deployments to killing pods and thwarting attacks, using Kubernetes for enforcement.

== Introduction to the RHACS console

The first section of this lab will focus on navigation and vulnerability management. This work will take place in the UI and require you to use both the dashboard and the lab environment.

=== Navigating the RHACS console

In this section, you familiarize yourself with the RHACS portal, including its tabs, search capabilities and dashboard functionality.

The RHACS dashboard has four main sections:

. Navigation bar
. Navigation drawer
. Dashboard

image::acs-numbered-dashboard.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Numbered Dashboard]

=== Navigation bar

The top bar contains the following functionality: 

- Global search 
- Command-line tools 
- Cluster health 
- Documentation 
- API reference 
- Enable dark/light Mode 
- Logged-in user account

image::acs-top-bar.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Navigation Bar]

=== 1. Global Search

The ability to instantly find resources is essential to safeguard your cluster. Utilize the RHACS search feature to find relevant resources faster.

For example, you can use it to find deployments exposed to a newly published CVE or all deployments with external network exposure.

A search query consists of two parts:

- An attribute that identifies the resource type you want to search for.
- A search term that finds the matching resource.

For example, to find all violations in the *ctf-web-to-system* deployment, the search query is *Deployment:ctf-web-to-system*.

In this search query, Deployment is the attribute, and ctf-web-to-system is the search term.

NOTE: The search field in RHACS requires each attribute to be entered fully as a search term. Enter your first attribute, and hit the <tab> key to move along to the next attribute you would like to enter. Results will appear once there are matches to the entered query.

image::acs-search-ctf-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Syntax]

NOTE: RHACS maintains a library of searchable assets to help you search faster, they will appear in a drop-down list, and you can click on them to enter them as well. If a specific CVE or deployment cannot be found, please confirm the spelling of the asset name, or that it is correctly deployed in the cluster. 

==== Common search queries

Here are some common search queries you can try in the RHACS search bar if you’d like to test its functionality.

|============
|Query|Example|Purpose
|CVE:<CVE_number>|CVE:CVE-2018-11776|Finding deployments that are affected by a specific CVE
|Privileged:<true_or_false>|Privileged:true|Finding privileged running deployments
|Exposure Level:<level>|Exposure Level:External|Finding deployments that have external network exposure
|============

image::acs-search-cve.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Syntax]

NOTE: This is just a sample of the types of queries you can use to analyze your environment in RHACS. For additional examples of search queries, please see the RHACS documentation.

==== Local page filtering

You can use local page filtering from within all views in the RHACS portal. Local page filtering works similarly to the global search, but only relevant attributes are available. You can select the search bar to show all available attributes for a specific view.

=== 2. Navigation menu

image::acs-nav-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Navigation Menu]

The left-hand navigation menu provides access to each of the security use cases, as well as product configuration to integrate RHACS with your existing tooling. The navigation menu has the following items:

- Dashboard: Summary view of your environment
- Network Graph: Configured and actual network flows and the creation of Network Policies to implement network segmentation
- Violations: Events that do not match the defined security policies
- Compliance: Several industry and regulatory security standards, such as PCI DSS
- Vulnerability Management: Information about known vulnerabilities affecting your environment, including deployed workloads and infrastructure, risk acceptance and reporting.
- Configuration Management: Identification of potential misconfigurations that can lead to security issues
- Risk: Risks affecting your environment, such as suspicious executions
- Platform Configuration: RHACS configuration, policy management and integration details, including;
* Clusters
* Policy Management
* Integrations
* Access Control
* System Configuration
* System Health

=== 3. Dashboard 

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) Dashboard provides quick access to the data you need. It contains additional navigation shortcuts and actionable widgets that are easy to filter and customize so that you can focus on the data that matters most to you. You can view information about levels of risk in your environment, compliance status, policy violations, and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in images.

image::acs-dashboard-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Center Dashboard]

==== Navigating the main dashboard

The main dashboard is your place to look at the vulnerabilities, risk, compliance, and policy violations across your clusters and namespaces. This section addresses all of the functionality in the main dashboard to help you navigate it more effectively in the future.
The dashboard can be broken down into three main sections:

. The status bar
. The dashboard filter
. The actionable widgets

image::acs-dashboard-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Three Dashboard Sections]

==== 1. The status bar

The status bar provides at-a-glance numerical counters for critical resources. The counters reflect what is visible with your current access scope, defined by the roles associated with your user profile. 

These counters are clickable, providing fast access to the desired list view pages as follows:

|============
|Counter|Destination
|Clusters|Platform Configuration -> Clusters
|Nodes|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Nodes
|Violations|Violations Main Menu
|Deployments|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Deployments
|Images|Vulnerability Management -> Dashboard -> Images
|Secrets|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Secrets
|============

==== 2. The dashboard filter 

The dashboard includes a top-level filter that applies simultaneously to all widgets. You can select clusters and one or more namespaces within selected clusters. Any change to the filter is immediately reflected by all widgets, limiting the data they present to the selected scope.

NOTE: The dashboard filter does not affect the status bar and when no clusters or namespaces are selected, the view automatically switches to All.

image::acs-dashboard-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Filter]

image::acs-dashboard-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dashboard Drop-down]

==== 3. Actionable widgets

If you have time, adjust the dashboard filtering options and widgets to hone the filtering capabilities.

With these widgets, you can customize the information displayed on the dashboard by default in order to find the items that you consider most important to your deployments and your business' security.

[[vuln-mgmt]]

== The Vulnerability Management dashboard

Let us continue by looking at our primary use case for RHACS and that is the Vulnerability Management features and dashboard, a familiar topic for most security teams.

IMPORTANT: The locations and size of your panels may vary depending on your screen size and zoom.

NOTE: For the following section, please note that the order in which the images appear or the number of components affected may vary depending on versions and other applications running in the cluster.

. Click the *Vulnerability Management (1.0)* tab, and then select *Dashboard*

image::acs-vuln-dashboard-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Vulnerability Management Dashboard]

The dashboard provides several important vulnerability breakdowns such as:

- Top risky deployments/images
- Recently detected image vulnerabilities
- Most common image vulnerabilities

More important than fixing any vulnerability is establishing a process to keep container images updated and to prevent the promotion through the pipeline for images with serious, fixable vulnerabilities. RHACS displays this through the *Top Risky Deployments by CVE and CVSS Score* and takes the container’s configuration and vulnerability details to show you the most *at risk* deployments in your cluster.

image::acs-vuln-dashboard-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Deployments]

[start=2]

. Above the panel information, there are buttons to link you to all policies, CVEs, and images, and a menu to bring you to reports by cluster, namespace, deployment, and component. The vulnerability dashboard can be filtered by clicking the *Fixable CVSS score* button.

image::acs-vuln-dashboard-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Top Policy Buttons]

[start=3]

. Locate the *Top riskiest images* panel. 

Here you can see the CVEs associated with containers currently running in the cluster. The goal is to find the *log4shell* exploit in your cluster and block that container from being pushed in the future.

image::acs-risk-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

[start=4]

. In the *Top Riskiest Images* panel, click on the *VIEW ALL* button.

image::acs-risk-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

The images in this dashboard are listed here in order of *risk*, 

Risk is based on a multitude of security issues such as

- the severity of the vulnerabilities present
- in the components in the images
- vulnerability impact
- the image is active

image::acs-risk-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

Notice which images are more exposed. Not only can we see the number of CVEs affecting the images, but which of them are fixable? We can also see:

- Creation date
- Scan time
- Image OS
- Image status
- How many deployments are using the vulnerable image
- The total components in the image

[start=5]

. Next, find and click on the image *ctf-web-to-system:latest-v2*. You will review the images' components and violations.

image::acs-risk-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Visa Processor Image]

NOTE: If you cannot find the ctf-web-to-system:latest-v2 image, use the search bar to filter for the specific image you want. Try searching by *deployment* And then entering *ctf-web-to-system*

image::acs-risk-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Search Bar]

You can move on to the next section only when the dashboard displays the image below.

image::acs-risk-07.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Image Info]

[[vuln-scanner]]

=== RHACS Vulnerability Scanner

RHACS' Scanner v4 is a built-in vulnerability scanner breaks down images into layers and components - where components can be operating-system installed packages or dependencies installed by programming languages like Python, Javascript, Go, Java and more. The *Image Summary tab* provides the essential security details of the image overall, with links to the components. Below you can see why the image is ranked as a critically vulnerable application:

- In the *Details and metadata* → Image Summary panel, the information you see there tells you that this image has a severe security problem - the base image was imported several years ago (Debian 8 - 2015).
- At the top of the page is the warning that CVE data is stale - that this image has a base OS version whose distribution has stopped providing security information and likely stopped publishing security fixes. ACS will still scan for language issues even if the Operating System does not have CVE dat available.

. Scroll down the page to the *Image Findings* section.

Here you find the details of the image vulnerabilities. There are 82 vulnerabilities detected with 80 of those vulnerabilities listed as fixable (at the time of the creation of this workshop.)

image::acs-vulns-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Fixable Vulnerabilities]

[start=2]

. Above the Image Findings section, click on the *Dockerfile* tab:

image::acs-vulns-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Dockerfile View]

The Dockerfile tab view shows the layer-by-layer view, and, as you can see, the most recent layers are also several years old. Time is not kind to images and components - as vulnerabilities are discovered, RHACS will display newly discovered CVEs. The layers that are listed as Source=OS are not showing CVE data since the CVE feeds are stale or do not have an information. However, the Python libraries that are added to the container are showing vulnerabilities. For example the 'mercurial' package in the 4 layer.

image::acs-vulns-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


*Now let's put this UI to the test with a real use case!*

[[log4shell]]

=== log4shell CVE vulnerability analysis

It is time to find the components that have the log4shell vulnerability in your cluster. Zero day and high priority vulnerabilities need to be triaged quickly. The log4shell vulnerability provides a great example of how security teams can assess a vulnerability's impact quickly and effectively.

Check out the Red Hat advisory for more details:

. Head back to the *Top Riskiest Images* Dashboard. (Vulnerability Management (1.0) → Top Riskiest Images)

image::acs-log4shell-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Riskiest Images]

. Search for the log4shell vulnerability using its CVE number (*CVE-2021-44228*)

image::acs-log4shell-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, log4shell Search]

- How many images are affected by the vulnerability?
- How many deployments contain the vulnerability?
- Why do you think the risk priority is where it is?
- Should the risk priority be higher? Or lower?

NOTE: The log4shell CVE is very serious - scoring 10/10 - and is fixable.

Luckily there is only *ONE* image being affected by this vulnerability (1 deployment), so we will want to fix this deployment and put a policy in place so that this vulnerability is never introduced back into the environment.

*How would your DevSecOps team address this vulnerability?*

[[policy-mgmt]]

== Policy Management

RHACS has many built-in policies to detect activity related to attacker goals: gain a foothold, maintain a presence, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. The continuous runtime monitoring observes all container activity and will automatically respond to events with appropriate enforcement and notification. However, that would be missing out on an opportunity - RHACS wants to go one step further, to take advantage of containers' ephemeral, immutable nature, to improve security in a measurable way from now on.

We want to use runtime incidents and vulnerabilities as a learning opportunity to improve security going forward by constraining how our containers can act. We achieve this by creating policies and implementing them early in the CI/CD process.

As we move into this next section, let's focus on identifying and enforcing a runtime policy in the cluster. For the upcoming example, we will focus on stopping the Ubuntu package manager from being run on pods in our cluster. 

Our example container *ctf-web-to-system* has this package manager in the container. Let's ensure that it never calls for updates while present in our clusters.

. On the left-hand side of the application, click the *Platform Configuration* tab and select *Policy Management*.

image::acs-policy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Dashboard]

[start=2]

. Filter through the policies to find *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* or use the search bar to select by *category*.

image::acs-policy-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Search]

[start=3]

. Once you have found the policy *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution*, click on it to learn more.

image::acs-policy-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Policy Management Details]

NOTE: If you click the actions button, you will see how easy it is to edit, clone, export or disable these policies. We also recommended cloning the policies and adding or removing specific filters as you need them.

[[runtime-enforce]]

== Introduction to *Runtime* policy enforcement

RHACS observes container processes and collects this information to enable you to craft policies to prevent behavior that you don’t like. This information can also create baseline policy configurations that the user can update.

The example below demonstrates how security may want to block a package manager from downloading any packages to the container. This runtime enforcement option is the first in the process of shifting left. After runtime enforcement, you will want to stop the package manager from being used in the container altogether.

=== Prevent execution of package manager binary

Package managers like apt (Ubuntu), apk (Alpine), or yum/dnf (RedHat) are binary software components used to manage and update installed software on a Linux® host system. They are used extensively to manage running virtual machines. But using a package manager to install or remove software on a running container violates the immutable principle of container operation.

This policy demonstrates how RHACS detects and avoids a runtime violation, using Linux kernel instrumentation to detect the running process and OpenShift® to terminate the pod for enforcement. Using OpenShift to enforce runtime policy is preferable to enforcing rules directly within containers or in the container engine, as it avoids a disconnect between the state that OpenShift is maintaining and the state where the container is operating. Furthermore, because a runtime policy may detect only part of an attacker’s activity inside a container, removing the container avoids the attack.

=== Enable enforcement of policy

. Navigate to *Platform Configuration → Policy Management* and find the *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* policy.
. On the *Policy Management* page, type *Policy* then *Ubuntu* into the filter bar at the top.

image::acs-runtime-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]

. Select the policy *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution*.

. Click the *Actions* button then click *Edit policy*.

image::acs-runtime-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Select the *Policy Behavior* tab by hitting next or clicking the tab.

image::acs-runtime-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]

. Enable runtime enforcement by clicking the *inform and enforce* button.
. Configure enforcement behavior by selecting *Enforce at Runtime*.

image::acs-runtime-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Enforce Runtime Policy]

[start=8]

. Go to the *Review Policy* tab
. Review the changes
. Click save

IMPORTANT: Make sure to save the policy changes! If you do not save the policy the process will not be blocked!

=== Testing the configured Policy

Next, we will use tmux to watch OpenShift events while running the test, so you can see how RHACS enforces the policy at runtime.

IMPORTANT: You will need to complete the following commands in the *Bastion VM* Please SSH to it (If you have not already) by using the following command:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

----
ssh {bastion_ssh_user_name}@{bastion_public_hostname}
----

Make sure you use the password '{bastion_ssh_password}' when prompted.

[start=1]

. On your Bastion VM, ssh over to the *Bastion* host, and start tmux with two panes:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; attach
----

[start=2]

. Next, run a watch on OpenShift events in the first shell pane:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get events -w
----

[start=3]

. Press *Ctrlb, o* to switch to the next pane. (Ctrlb THEN o)
. Exec into our Java application by getting the pod details and adding them to the following command.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
POD=$(oc get pod -l app=ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
oc exec $POD -i --tty -- /bin/bash
----

*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ POD=$(oc get pod -l app=ctf-web-to-system -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
oc exec $POD -i --tty -- /bin/bash
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-hz6j2:/app$
----

NOTE: If you see *node@ctf...* you've confirmed you have a shell and access to the Java application.

. Run the Ubuntu package manager in this shell:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
apt update
----

. Examine the output and expect to see that the package manager attempts to perform an update operation:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-stwhq:/$ apt update
Reading package lists... Done
E: List directory /var/lib/apt/lists/partial is missing. - Acquire (13: Permission denied)
node@ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-stwhq:/$ command terminated with exit code 137
----

. Examine the oc get events tmux pane (The pane on the bottom), and note that it shows that RHACS detected the package manager invocation and deleted the pod:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
0s          Normal    Killing                  pod/ctf-web-to-system-6db858448f-hz6j2    Stopping container ctf-web-container

----

NOTE: After a few seconds you can see the pod is deleted a recreated. In your tmux shell pane, note that your shell session has terminated and that you are returned to the Bastion VM command line.

Congrats! You have successfully stopped yourself from downloading malicious packages! However, the security investigative process continues, as you have now raised a flag that must be triaged! We will triage our violations after we look at deploy time policies.

NOTE: type exit in the terminal twice to get back to the default terminal.

[[deploy-enforce]]

== Introduction to *Deploy-Time* policy enforcement

There are two approaches to enforcing deploy-time policies in RHACS:

- In clusters with **listen** and **enforce** AdmissionController options enabled, RHACS uses the admission controller to reject deployments that violate policy.
- In clusters where the admission controller option is disabled, RHACS scales pod replicas to zero for deployments that violate policy.

== Prevent the Ubuntu Package Manager in the ctf-web-to-system image from being deployed

. Navigate to Platform Configuration → Policy Management
. On the *Policy Management* page, type *Policy* then *Ubuntu* into the filter bar at the top.

NOTE: This time we are going to edit a different policy. Specifically related to the *Build & Deploy* phases.

[start=3]

. Click on the *Ubuntu Package Manager in Image* options (The three dots on the right side of the screen) and select *Clone policy*

image::acs-deploy-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]

. Give the policy a new name. Something you will remember. For example;

image::acs-deploy-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Next, update the policy to inform and enforce while clicking on the deploy stage only.

image::acs-deploy-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]

Now we want to target our specific deployment with an image label.

. Click on the *Policy criteria* tab.
. Click on the *Image contents* dropdown on the right side of the browser.
. Find the *Namespace* label and drag it to the default policy criteria.
. Default only

You're policy should look like this,

image::acs-deploy-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Lastly, go to the *Review Policy* tab
. Review the changes
. Click save

image::acs-deploy-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

== Report and Resolve Violations


. Navigate to the *Violations* page.
. Filter by the policy violation *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* OR by the most recent policy violations. You will see a policy violation that has been enforced 1 time.
. Click the most recent violation and explore the list of the violation events:

image::250-violations.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Violations Menu]

If configured, each violation record is pushed to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration, and is available to be retrieved via the API. The forensic data shown in the UI is recorded, including the timestamp, process user IDs, process arguments, process ancestors, and enforcement action.

After this issue is addressed, in this case by the RHACS product using the runtime enforcement action, you can remove it from the list by marking it as *Resolved*.

. Lastly, hover over the violation in the list to see the resolution options and resolve this issue as operator error.

image::251-resolve-violation.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Resolve Violations]

For more information about integration with SIEM tools, see the RHACS help documentation on external tools.

Congratulations! You successfully stopped packages from being downloaded to the host by setting a runtime enforcement policy.

== Conclusion

In summary, we made use of the features provided by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes to display potential security violations in your cluster in a central dashboard. We also used the default tools to examine known image vulnerabilities and network communication and segmentation in our cluster. Lastly we crafted both deploy-time and runtime policies to help prevent malicious events from occurring in our cluster. Hopefully this lab has helped demonstrate to you the immense value provided by RHACS and OpenShift Platform Plus. Please feel free to continue and explore the RHACS lab environment, or continue on to the next portion of the lab at your leisure.

=== roxctl CLI verification 

Next, verify that you have access to the RHACS Central Service.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following command.

====
This command uses variables saved in the ~/.bashrc file to authenticate with the RHACS Central Service.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" central whoami

NOTE: This output indicates you have full access to the RHACS product. You can check these permissions in the RHACS Access Control tab, which you'll review later.

If you have full access, you're all set!

== Deploy the workshop applications

You now have access to the core OPP applications. Next, you'll deploy several insecure apps into the OpenShift cluster. These demo apps come from public GitHub repositories and cover various vulnerabilities, including well-known Capture the Flag (CTF) apps, Log4Shell, and Apache Struts.

After deployment, you'll use the roxctl CLI to scan some containers, giving you a preview of what to expect during the security section with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security.

=== Time to deploy

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following commands in the terminal, one after the other.

====
This command downloads a repository container dockerfiles, attack scripts, and Kubernetes manifests that you will use to deploy the containerized applications to OpenShift.  
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/mfosterrox/demo-apps.git demo-apps
----

====
This command sets the variable TUTORIAL_HOME to equal the working directory, allowing you to make references to various files easily.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo export GRPC_ENFORCE_ALPN_ENABLED=FALSE >> ~/.bashrc
echo export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps" >> ~/.bashrc
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
----

====
This command applies the manifests into the OpenShift environment.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
namespace/operations created
namespace/backend created
....
route.route.openshift.io/webgoat created
configmap/webgoat-config created
----

NOTE: You may see warnings like: Warning: would violate PodSecurity "baseline:latest": privileged (container "proxy" must not set securityContext.privileged=true). These warnings appear because you are deploying containers with flawed configurations and known vulnerabilities into the OpenShift cluster.

====
The following command will display what applciations have been deployed to the cluster
====

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployments -l demo=roadshow -A

IMPORTANT: Please ensure the deploy application are deployed and available before moving onto the next module. 

====
The following command triggers a vulnerability scan by RHACS, roxctl filters the results into a table. The severity flag means only the critical vulnerabilities will be shown. This image is known as the "Damn Vulnerable Wed Application" and it contains A LOT of vulnerabilities.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/mfoster/dvwa --force -o table
----

TIP: The following output can be configured using flags. You can configure different outputs (table, CSV, JSON, and sarif.) and filter for specific severities.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/mfoster/dvwa --force -o table 
Scan results for image: quay.io/mfoster/dvwa

=== roxctl CLI verification 

Next, verify that you have access to the RHACS Central Service.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following command.

====
This command uses variables saved in the ~/.bashrc file to authenticate with the RHACS Central Service.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" central whoami

NOTE: This output is showing that you have unrestricted access to the RHACS product. These permissions can be seen in the **RHACS Access Control** tab that you will review later.

If you have full access you are ready to go!

== Deploy the workshop applications

You now have access to the core OPP applications. Next, you'll deploy several insecure apps into the OpenShift cluster. Our insecure demo applications come from a variety of public GitHub repositories and sources. These apps will serve as the main use cases you examine during the workshop, ranging from well-known Capture the Flag (CTF) applications to vulnerabilities like Log4Shell and Apache Struts.

After deploying the applications, you'll scan some of these containers using the roxctl CLI to get a feel for what you'll be dealing with when you get to the security section with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security

=== Time to deploy

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following commands in the terminal, one after the other.

====
This command downloads a repository container dockerfiles, attack scripts, and Kubernetes manifests that you will use to deploy the containerized applications to OpenShift.  
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/mfosterrox/demo-apps.git demo-apps
----

====
This command sets the variable TUTORIAL_HOME to equal the working directory, allowing you to make references to various files easily.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps" >> ~/.bashrc
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
----

====
This command applies the manifests into the OpenShift environment.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
namespace/operations created
namespace/backend created
....
route.route.openshift.io/webgoat created
configmap/webgoat-config created
----

NOTE: You should see warnings such as: *Warning: would violate PodSecurity "baseline:latest": privileged (container "proxy" must not set securityContext.privileged=true)*. This is because you are deploying flawed container configurations and vulnerable container applications into the OpenShift cluster.

====
The following command will watch all of the applications as they are successfully deployed into the Openshift cluster. You can press ctrl+c to terminate the command.
====

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployments -l demo=roadshow -A -w

IMPORTANT: Please ensure the deploy application are deployed and available before moving onto the next module. 

[start=2]
. Run the following roxctl commands to check on the vulnerability status of the applications you deployed.

====
The following command triggers a vulnerability scan by RHACS, roxctl filters the results into a table. The severity flag means only the critical vulnerabilities will be shown. This image is known as the "Damn Vulnerable Wed Application" and it contains A LOT of vulnerabilities.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/mfoster/dvwa --force -o table
----

TIP: The following output can be configured using flags. You can configure different outputs (table, CSV, JSON, and sarif.) and filter for specific severities.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/mfoster/dvwa --force -o table 
Scan results for image: quay.io/mfoster/dvwa

== Summary

In this module, you got access to all of the lab UI's and interfaces including the Showroom lab enviroment (Where you are reading this). You downloaded and deployed some very insecure applications and set up the lab full of examples to dive into. 

*Time to test out your developer skills!*

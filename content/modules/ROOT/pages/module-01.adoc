=== roxctl CLI verification 

Next, verify that we have access to the RHACS Central Service.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following command.

====
This command uses variables saved in the ~/.bashrc file to authenticate with the RHACS Central Service.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" central whoami

NOTE: This output is showing that you have unrestricted access to the RHACS product. These permissions can be seen in the **RHACS Access Control** tab that we will review later.

If you have full access you are ready to go!

== Deploy the workshop applications

You now have access to the core OPP applications. Next, you'll deploy a bunch of insecure apps into the OpenShift cluster. Our insecure demo applications come from a variety of public GitHub repositories and sources. These apps will be the main use cases we look at during the workshop and range from some well know Capture the Flag (CTF) applications to log4shell and Apache struts vulnerabilities. 

After you deploy the applications you'll scan a few of these containers using the *roxctl* CLI to get a feeling about what you will be dealing with when you get to the security section with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security.

=== Time to deploy

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following commands in the terminal, one after the other.

====
This command downloads a repository container dockerfiles, attack scripts, and Kubernetes manifests that you will use to deploy the containerized applications to OpenShift.  
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/mfosterrox/demo-apps.git demo-apps
echo export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps" >> ~/.bashrc
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
----

====
This command applies the manifests into the OpenShift environment.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
namespace/operations created
namespace/backend created
....
route.route.openshift.io/webgoat created
configmap/webgoat-config created
----

NOTE: You should see warnings such as: *Warning: would violate PodSecurity "baseline:latest": privileged (container "proxy" must not set securityContext.privileged=true)*. This is because we are deploying flawed container configurations and vulnerable container applications into the OpenShift cluster.

[start=2]
. For the last step. Run the following command to varify that the applications are up and running. 

====
The following command will watch all of the applications as they are successfully deployed into the Openshift cluster. You can press ctrl+c to terminate the command.
====

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployments -l demo=roadshow -A -w

IMPORTANT: Please ensure the deploy application are deployed and available before moving onto the next module. 

[start=3]
. Let's take a quick look at some of the applications that you deployed. 

====
The following command triggers a vulnerability scan by RHACS, roxctl filters the results into a table. The severity flag means only the critical vulnerabilities will be shown.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/mfoster/juice-shop:0.1 --force -o table 
----

TIP: The following output can be configured using flags. You can configure different outputs (table, CSV, JSON, and sarif.) and filter for specific severities.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[demo-user@bastion ~]$ roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/mfoster/juice-shop:0.1 --force -o table 
Scan results for image: quay.io/mfoster/juice-shop:0.1

*Beautiful!*

In this module, you got access to all of the lab UI's and interfaces including the Showroom lab enviroment (Where you are reading this sentence). You downloaded and deployed some very insecure applications and setup the lab full of examples to dive into.

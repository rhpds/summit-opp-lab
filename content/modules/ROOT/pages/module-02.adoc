= Store, Scan and Deploy Applications with Red Hat Quay

In this module, you'll act as the developer, selecting a base image to build your application on. You’ll start by downloading and storing a Python "Golden image," then add your application code to create a deployable app. In the next module, we'll hand off this app to the Operations team to deploy it to the OpenShift cluster.

[[build-app]]

[[quay-login]]

== Login to Quay from the CLI

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following command.

====
Let’s export a few variables to simplify the process. These variables will be saved in the .bashrc file, so they persist even if you need to refresh the terminal.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo export QUAY_USER={quay_admin_username} >> ~/.bashrc
QUAY_USER={quay_admin_username}
echo export QUAY_URL=$(oc -n quay get route quay-quay -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}') >> ~/.bashrc
QUAY_URL=$(oc -n quay get route quay-quay -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

[start=2]

Verify that the variables are correct, by running the command below.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

[lab-user@bastion ~]$ echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
quayadmin
quay-bq65l.apps.cluster-bq65l.bq65l.sandbox209.opentlc.com
----

[start=3]
. Using the terminal on the bastion host, login to quay using the Podman CLI as shown below:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
podman login $QUAY_URL
----

NOTE: Use the quay admin credentials to sign in. 

[cols="2,2"]

*Quay Password:* | *{quay_admin_password}* 
|===

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Username: quayadmin
Password:
Login Succeeded!
----

Beautiful! We're logged in. Now you can download build and push images directly to your quay repository.

[[golden-image]]

=== Create our developer golden image

A base image is like a blank canvas, offering a solid foundation such as a minimal operating system or runtime environment. Developers then add the necessary configurations, libraries, and tools for their application. By tagging this customized setup as a golden image, developers ensure consistency across deployments, streamlining workflows and avoiding unexpected issues.

*Procedure*

. Run the following commands in succession

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
podman pull python:3.12-alpine

[[dev-app]]

=== Create the frontend application, and upload it to Quay

In this section, you'll add the application code to the image, then build, tag, and push the new image to Quay. Later, we'll use this image to deploy the application to the OpenShift cluster.

IMPORTANT: With the variables saved in the ~/.bashrc file you will not have to declare them again in the future. 

*Procedure*

. List the contents of the `frontend` directory inside the `app-images` folder to see the files available for the project.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----

NOTE: Quay will automatically create a private registry to store the application image due to your admin access. To deploy the application, ensure the repository is set to public so you can pull the image without authentication.

The frontend application is ready! Next, we'll review it in Quay and deploy it to OpenShift using ACM and OpenShift GitOps. First, let's make the repository public so we can deploy the application without requiring credentials.

[[quay]]

== Accessing Quay 

Your Red Hat Quay console is available at: {quay_console_url}[window=blank]

Administrator login is available with:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| *Quay Console Username:* | {quay_admin_username} |
| *Quay Console Password:* | {quay_admin_password} |
|===

[[navigating-the-registry]]

== Browse the registry

In the setup module, you downloaded, built, and pushed an insecure Java application called frontend. Now, it's time to deploy it to the OpenShift Cluster. To proceed, you'll need to make the registry you created public.

Let's take a look at the application in the registry.

*Procedure*

. First, click on the *frontend* repository. 

image::02-quay-login.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The information tab shows you information such as;

- Podman and Docker commands
- Repository activity
- The repository description. 

image::02-frontend-repo.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

====
On the left hand side of the window you should see the following icons labelled in order from top to bottom,
====

image::02-quay-sidebar.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

- Information
- Tags
- Tag History
- Usage Logs
- Settings


[start=2]
. Click on the *Tags* icon. 

image::02-quay-tags.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab shows all the images and tags that have been uploaded, including details like fixable vulnerabilities, image size, and the option to make bulk changes based on the security posture.

We’ll explore this tab in more detail later in the module.

[start=3]
. Click on the *Tags History* icon. 

image::02-quay-history.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab simply displays the container images history over time. 

[start=4]
. Click into the SHA256 hash number. 

image::02-image-details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

From this dashboard you will be able to see the image manifest of that container image.

image::02-image-manifest.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Click the *BACK* icon in the top left of the dashboard then click on the *Usage Logs* icon. 

image::02-quay-back.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
image::02-quay-usage.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


This tab displays the usage over time along with details about who/how the images were pushed to the cluster. 

====
You should see that you (The "quayadmin") pushed an image tagged 0.1 to the repository today. 
====

[start=6]
. Lastly click on the *Settings* icon. 

image::02-quay-settings.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

In this tab you can add/remove users and update permissions, alter the privacy of the repository, and even schedule alerts based on found vulnerabilities.

[start=7]
. Make your repository public before deploying our application in the next step by clicking the *Make Public* button under *Repository Visibility*

image::02-quay-public.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: Make sure to make the repository public. Otherwise you will not be able to deploy the application in the ACM section.

[start=8]
. Click OK

image::02-quay-public-yes.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Great! The frontend application can now be deployed with ACM without using pull secrets. 

[[vulnerability-scanning-with-quay]]

== Vulnerability Scanning with Quay

Red Hat Quay helps secure environments by performing container vulnerability scans on images added to the registry, identifying which vulnerabilities are potentially fixable. This is known as vulnerability scanning at rest.

Follow the procedure below to check the security scan results for the Java container image you've uploaded.

*Procedure*

. Click on the *Tags* icon on the left side of the screen like before.

image::02-quay-tags.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. By default, the security scan color codes the vulnerabilities, you can hover over the security scan for more information.

image::02-quay-scan-hover.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: The alpine container image you are using in this lab shows 34 vulnerabilities, with 2 cirtical vulnerabilities. This number will change with time and will be different between container scanners for a variety of reasons such as reporting mechanisms, vulnerability feeds and operating system support. 

[start=3]
. Click on the list of vulnerabilities to see a more detailed view.

image::02-quay-security.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%] 

image::02-quay-vuln-overview.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
. Click on a vulnerable package on the left menu to get more information about the vulnerability and see what you have to do to fix the issue.

image::02-quay-vuln-detailed.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: Toggling for fixable/unfixable vulnerabilities is an excellent way for developers to understand what is within their responsibility for fixing. For example, since you are using an older version of Java, many fixes are available for these common issues. 

=== Ensure ACS can pull the image manifest from your Quay instance

There is currently no integration with the Quay repository which means ACS cannot view the manifest layers. You can verify this by running a similar roxctl scan that you ran before.

*Procedure*

. Run the following command to test the RHACS/Quay integration

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=$QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/frontend:0.1 --force -o table
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ERROR:  Scanning image failed: retrieving image scan result: could not scan image: "quay-nhxdx.apps.cluster-nhxdx.nhxdx.sandbox4561.opentlc.com/quayadmin/frontend:0.1": rpc error: code = Internal desc = image enrichment error: error getting metadata for image: quay-nhxdx.apps.cluster-nhxdx.nhxdx.sandbox4561.opentlc.com/quayadmin/frontend:0.1 error: no matching image registries found: please add an image integration for quay-nhxdx.apps.cluster-nhxdx.nhxdx.sandbox4561.opentlc.com.

----

[start=2]
. Next, run the following command in the terminal to add the Quay integration to RHACS via an API call.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
# ACS API endpoint used to create the Quay repo integration
POST_ENDPOINT="https://${ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS}/v1/imageintegrations"

=== Summary

Nice job! Developers can now build and push their images to Quay, view their image vulnerabilities, and use roxctl to scan their images.

*Time to hand it off to the Operations team and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management!*

= Red Hat Quay

Red Hat Quay is an enterprise-quality registry for building, securing and serving container images. It provides secure storage, distribution, governance of containers and cloud-native artifacts on any infrastructure.

To get started, make sure that you are logged in to Red Hat Quay and have access to the newly created *quayadmin/ctf-web-to-system* repository

[[access-quay]]

== Access Quay 

Your Red Hat Quay console is available at: {quay_console_url}[window=blank]

Administrator login is available with:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

[cols="1,1"]
|===
*Quay Console Username:* | {quay_admin_username} |
*Quay Console Password:* | {quay_admin_password} |

== Browse the registry

In the setup module we downloaded built and pushed a insecure java application called *ctf-web-to-system*. Now it's time to deploy it to the OpenShift Cluster. To do this we will need to make the registry that we created public. 

Let's take a look at our application in the registry.

. Next, click on the *ctf-web-to-system* repository. 

image::quay-repo.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

On the left hand side of the window you should see the following icons labelled in order from top to bottom,

image::quay-sidebar.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

- Information
- Tags
- Tag History
- Usage Logs
- Settings

The information tab shows you information such as;

- Podman and Docker commands
- Repository activity
- The repository description. 

image::quay-information.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click on the *Tags* icon. 

image::quay-tags.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab displays all of the images and tags that have been upladed, providing information such as fixable vulnerabilities, the image size and allows for bulk changes to images based on the security posture. 

image::quay-tags-security.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. Click on the *Tags History* icon. 

image::quay-tags-history.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab simply displays the container images history over time. 

[start=4]
. Click on the *Usage Logs* icon. 

This tab displays the usage over time along with details about who/how the images were pushed to the cluster. 

image::quay-usage-logs.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You can see that you (The "quayadmin") pushed an image tagged 1.0 to the repository today. 

[start=5]
. Lastly click on the *Settings* icon. 

image::quay-settings.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

In this tab you can add/remove users and update permissions, alter the privacy of the repository, and even schedule alerts based on found vulnerabilities.

image::quay-tags-security.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: Make sure to make the repository public. Otherwise we will not be able to deploy the application in the next step.

[start=6]
. Make your repository public before deploying our application in the next step by clicking the *Make Public* button under `Repository Visability`

image::quay-make-public.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=7]
. Click OK

image::quay-make-public-ok.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[[vulnerability-scanning-with-quay]]

== Vulnerability Scanning with Quay

Red Hat Quay can also help with securing our environments by performing a security scan on any images added to our registry, and advise which ones are potentially fixable.

Use the following procedure to check the security scan results for our Java container image you have uploaded.

. Click on the *Tags* icon on the left side of the screen like before.

image::quay-tags.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: You may need to click the checkbox near the image you would would like more information on, but the column for *Security Scan* should populate.

[start=2]
. By default, the security scan color codes the vulnerabilities, you can hover over the security scan for more information.

image::quay-scan-hover.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: The Java container image we are using in this lab shows 12 vulnerabilities, with 1 high vulnerabilities. This number will change with time and will be different between container scanners for a variety of reasons such as reporting mechanisms, vulnerability feeds and operating system support. 

. Click on the list of vulnerabilities to see a more detailed view.

image::quay-security-detailed.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%, Image Security Details] 

. Click on a vulnerabile package on the left menu to get more information about the vulnerability and see what you have to do to fix the issue.

image::quay-vuln-detailed.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: Toggling for fixable/unfixable vulnerabilities is an excellent way for developers to understand what is within their responsibility for fixing. For example, since we are using an older version of Java, many fixes are available for these common issues. 

Congratulations, you now know how to examine images in your registry for potential vulnerabilities before deploying into your environment.

IMPORTANT: Please ensure the deploy application are deployed to your cluster before moving onto the next module. 

[[deploy-the-java-application]]

== Deploy the Java application

IMPORTANT: You will need to complete the following commands in the *Bastion VM* Please SSH to it (If you have not already) by using the following command:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

----
ssh {bastion_ssh_user_name}@{bastion_public_hostname}
----

Make sure you use the password '{bastion_ssh_password}' when prompted.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to REMOVE the *https://* from the URL command below.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export QUAY_USER={quay_admin_username}
export QUAY_URL={quay_console_url} #remove https://
----

Our insecure demo applications come from a variety of public GitHub repositories and sources. Including the Java application that you just pushed to Quay. Let's deploy them into our cluster.

. Run the following command in the Bastion VM. 

[NOTE]
This command downloads a bunch of Kubernetes manifests to deploy to OpenShift. We also add the location of the local repository for our ctf-web-to-system application. 

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/mfosterrox/demo-apps.git demo-apps
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
sed -i "s|CHANGEME|$QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/ctf-web-to-system:1.0|g" $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ctf-web-to-system/ctf-w2s.yml
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/openshift-pipelines/ --recursive
----

[IMPORTANT]
You should see warnings such as: Warning: would violate PodSecurity "restricted:latest": unrestricted capabilities (container "Java" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=["ALL"]) this is because we are deploying flawed container configurations and vulnerabile container applications into the OpenShift cluster.


[start=2]
. Run the following command and ensure that the applications are up and running

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
kubectl get deployments -l demo=roadshow -A
----

*Output*
```bash
NAMESPACE    NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

payments     visa-processor      1/1     1            1           4h38m
```

[NOTE]
The main focus needs to be that the *ctf-web-to-system* application deployed properly. 

Nice job!

== Conclusion

We hope you have enjoyed this lab using Red Hat Quay to create and host your own repository, upload and use an image, and examine the image for security vulnerabilites.
